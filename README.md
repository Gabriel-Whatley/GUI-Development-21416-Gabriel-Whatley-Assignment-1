# GUI Development Assignment #1 Pill Dispenser Interface - Gabriel Whatley

- I used Moqups to design the UI

- In version 1 I tried to capture all of the basic functions of the machine. The main screen shows both a countdown to the next dispense and the date and time of the next dispense. I figured user preference would be between those two methods of displaying when the next dose would be available. The main maeny features a login screen for a password to unlock the management features of the software. This was done in case the computer is accessible to the patient and in the event that the drugs contained in the dispenser are controlled substances it would be best to only allow authorized personnel to access the dispensing controls.

- Comments on Image 2 - what primary funcï¿½ons did you represent, what do you think is good about the
design, what may be missing.

- My favorite feature is from design 2 the flexible scheduling system.
