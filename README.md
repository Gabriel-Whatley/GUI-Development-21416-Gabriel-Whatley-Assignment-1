# GUI Development Assignment #1 Pill Dispenser Interface - Gabriel Whatley

I used Moqups to design the UI

In version 1 I tried to capture all of the basic functions of the machine:
- The main screen shows both a countdown to the next dispense and the date and time of the next dispense. I figured user preference would be between those two methods of displaying when the next dose would be available.
- Pop-up windows notify the user that the machine has dispensed medicine or is out of medicine.
- The main menu features a login screen for a password to unlock the management features of the software. This was done in case the computer is accessible to the patient and in the event that the drugs contained in the dispenser are controlled substances it would be best to only allow authorized personnel to access the dispensing controls.
- The alert for the machine being out of medicine can only be dismissed by an authorized administrator to prevent the pop-up from being dismissed by the patient inadvertently.
- Once the authorized user has logged in they have access to edit the dispense schedule.
- The controls button takes the user to manual controls for the machine allowing them to manually control the carousel that contains the medicine cups.
- I think this UI's strongest point is that it isn't too complicated but shows a lot of information. (In my opinion, UAT might not agree!)
- UI could use more polish and color though that could come later it's just a mock-up.
- I think the scheduling system is simplistic and could be improved upon.

In version 2 I attempted to make the UI as simple as possible.
- The main screen simply shows a countdown progress bar to the next pill.
- The alerts for pill dispensing and out of pills appear in the main window without the need for a popup.
- The alerts are dismissed by clicking the screen.
- It's a very simple interface but some people might like it, not everyone cares to know down to the microsecond how long until their next pill will be available.

Between the two designs I like #1 more because it has more features and gives more control. my favorite feature is that it gives me more information about what is going on with the system and when the next pill will be dispensed. That way I could plan my day around taking my pills so I don't have whatever problem the pills are supposed to prevent. Or if I was tasked with managing the pill system as an employee the extra info and admin password would be nice.
