# GUI Development Assignment #1 Pill Dispenser Interface - Gabriel Whatley

I used Moqups to design the UI

In version 1 I tried to capture all of the basic functions of the machine:
- The main screen shows both a countdown to the next dispense and the date and time of the next dispense. I figured user preference would be between those two methods of displaying when the next dose would be available.
- Pop-up windows notify the user that the machine has dispensed medicine or is out of medicine.
- The main menu features a login screen for a password to unlock the management features of the software. This was done in case the computer is accessible to the patient and in the event that the drugs contained in the dispenser are controlled substances it would be best to only allow authorized personnel to access the dispensing controls.
- The alert for the machine being out of medicine can only be dismissed by an authorized administrator to prevent the pop-up from being dismissed by the patient inadvertently.
- Once the authorized user has logged in they have access to edit the dispense schedule.
- The controls button takes the user to manual controls for the machine allowing them to manually control the carousel that contains the medicine cups.
- I think this UI's strongest point is that it is fairly simple. (In my opinion, UAT might not agree!)
- UI could use more polish and color though that could come later it's just a mock-up.
- I think the scheduling system is simplistic and could be improved upon.

- Comments on Image 2 - what primary funcï¿½ons did you represent, what do you think is good about the
design, what may be missing.

- My favorite feature is from design 2 the flexible scheduling system.
